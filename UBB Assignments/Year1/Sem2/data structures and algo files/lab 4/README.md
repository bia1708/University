ADT SortedBag â€“ using  a  hashtable  with  coalesced  chaining  in  which  the  elements  are stored.  If  an  element  appears  multiple  times,  it  will  be  stored  multiple  times  in  the hashtable. In  the  constructor  of  the  iterator  create  a sorted  array  of  the  elements  and  use that array for iterating.
